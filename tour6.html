        Tikim and Timpla: A Bacolod Food and Crafts Crawl<br><br>
A perfectly seasoned day of tasting, making, and discovering the soulful heart of Negros.<br><br>

You simply can’t leave Bacolod without tasting the flavors it’s known and loved for. Join Team Tikim for a day: 
Tikim means “to taste,” while Timpla is “to mix” or “craft”… making this tour perfect for foodies and creative souls alike.<br><br>

Start with a bowl of rich, comforting cansi, a local beef bone broth simmered for hours with spices and batwan. Since Negros 
produces over 60% of the country’s sugar, it’s only fitting to indulge your sweet tooth: flaky napoleones, oversized melt-in-your-
mouth ensaimadas, crunchy piaya, and more. In the afternoon you’ll get to craft your own wind chime - a simple, beautiful keepsake to 
bring home. We’ve also included a heartwarming visit to the NVC Foundation, where upcycled Nespresso pods and mosaic art are turned into
 stunning pieces that help feed children in need… proof that creativity really can spark change.<br><br>
